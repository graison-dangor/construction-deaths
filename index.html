      <p class="byline">An essay of photos and text by Madeleine Crenshaw, Graison Dangor, Kyle Kucharski, Sarah Matusek, and Anya van Wagtendonk</p>

      <blockquote>You see a lot — an empty hole in the ground. You erect a building. It’s going to be there after you’re dead and gone, your kids is dead and gone, your grandkids are dead and gone. But it’s a legacy, that you was a part of bringing this building
        that people are going to be living and working [in].
        <p class="attribution">&ndash; Carlos, Ironworker</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Orange netting. Hunter green fences. In every borough and nearly every neighborhood of New York City, construction scaffolding is a familiar sight. Here, buildings are always in bloom. And as zoning laws change and development expands, gleaming
        new edifices seem to pop up overnight.</p>

      <img src="images/2ParkAve.jpg">
      <p>But Gotham doesn’t grow itself. Construction workers — carpenters, electricians, roofers, pipefitters, equipment operators, ironworkers — build the city upward. After their work ends and the scaffolds collapse, our streets and skylines are altered.
        We live, work and play within these creations.</p>
      <img src="images/135JoralemonStreet.jpg">
      <p>This work is dangerous. According to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, construction workers comprise only 5 percent of our city’s workforce, yet 27 percent of work-related fatalities. Although deaths have decreased in recent years, five construction
        workers died in the first three months of 2018.</p>
      <img src="images/161MaidenLane.jpg">
      <p>These on-the-job deaths result in violations issued by the Department of Buildings and the Environmental Control Board, fines that are easily paid off to resume construction. As a result, any New Yorker can walk past a house, an apartment building,
        a shuttered construction site, and never know that a person died at that spot while on the job. Thanks to monthly DOB reports, these grim statistics are public if you know where to look.</p>
      <img src="images/223ManhattanAve.jpg">
      <p>As photographers, we tracked down these death sites to explore what it means to live in a city built through sacrifice. We visited every building where a construction worker perished between January 2017 and March 2018, photographing each unintended
        memorial.

      <p>The following images aren’t extraordinary, but that’s the point. Their repetitive ordinariness reminds us that our built environment carries a legacy, left behind by working New Yorkers.</p>
